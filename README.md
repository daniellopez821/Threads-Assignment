The purpose of this coding assignment was to understand threads in Java.
We were required to create a project that shows multiple threads running at the same time
In the assignment we had to create an account class and show randomly generated number of deposits and withdrawals happening in the console.
One special note is that if the random number generated from the withdrawal was higher than the current amount in the account, The withdrawal thread would have to wait for the deposit thread to put more money in then try again.
